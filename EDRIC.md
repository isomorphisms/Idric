# Edric project checkpoint

This file is the durable handoff for the project called **Idriç**, **Idric**, or **Edric**. A new work thread should be able to start here without reconstructing the project from chat history.

## Canonical repository

`https://github.com/isomorphisms/Idric`

The repository's ASCII name is `Idric`. The intended project name is `Idriç`; `Edric` is also used in speech/transcription. All three names deliberately appear here so repository search can find the project.

## Foundation

Edric is an experimental Idris-derived compiler line built on the current Idris 2 compiler. The modern baseline for this checkpoint is Idris 2 commit:

`9b2116d98b5789afe3a003b234fd173c6b9aa379`

The older `isomorphisms/Idri-` / `Idris2-boot` work is historical reference only. Do **not** use that obsolete bootstrap tree as the foundation and do not replay its broad mechanical rewrite wholesale. Extract intentional language ideas from it individually and add each one to this modern tree with focused tests.

## Implementation rule

Use ordinary, current Idris 2 to implement Edric until an Edric change is itself stable enough to be deliberately dogfooded. Do not make the compiler depend on an unbuilt dialect of itself.

The first Edric-specific syntax is the storage-neutral `choice` declaration described below. The compiler remains implemented in ordinary Idris 2.

## Data-structure vocabulary

Edriç names a structure by what it is, not merely by whether its length is
known.

- `List A` is a list whose length is not part of its public type.
- `SizedList n A` or `ListOfLength n A` is a list whose length is part of
  its type. The length may be known in advance or computed while the program
  runs and then packaged with the list. If computing it can fail, the package
  belongs inside `Result` or `Maybe`.
- `Array n A` is indexed contiguous storage; it is not renamed merely
  because its length is known.
- `Vector` is reserved for a genuine mathematical or numeric vector,
  including shader vector values.

The inherited Idris 2 names `Vect` and `Data.Vect` remain where upstream
compatibility requires them. New Edriç APIs, examples, and explanations must
not use “vector” as a synonym for a list with a known or computed length.

## Floating-point source profile

Edriç source files (`.idric`) use `Float16` as the ordinary floating type.
Decimal floating literals are immediately passed through an IEEE-754 binary16
rounding boundary, and the `Float16` arithmetic instances round again after
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Type information is allowed to be ragged. An explicit `Double`, `Float`,
`Float32`, or `Float64` spelling in `.idric` is therefore not a hard error and
is not trusted as a demand for that physical precision. The parser normalizes
that spelling to `Float16` and emits a nonfatal warning of the form:

```text
Idriç: requested Double; running this as Float16
```

The same rule applies to the other wider spellings. Canonical `Float16` and
bare decimal literals do not produce a narrowing warning.

The current implementation uses inherited `Double` only as an internal carrier
for the `Float16` record. That carrier does not determine source semantics: the
binary16 rounding boundary is executable and regression-tested. Direct CPU and
GPU backends may later replace the carrier with native or unboxed Float16
storage and instructions without changing the source-language rule.

Ordinary `.idr` files retain inherited Idris `Double` behavior. Compiler
implementation code and compatibility code may therefore continue using wider
host arithmetic without exposing those wider precisions as the normal Idriç
source semantics.

## Storage-neutral choices

Files ending in `.idric` may declare a non-parameterized choice with lower
snake_case names:

```idris
choice existing_touch_target one_of
  fixed_value Nat
  zero Nat
  pole Nat

choice touch_beginning one_of
  near_existing existing_touch_target
  empty_domain

choice placement_kind one_of
  new_zero
  new_pole
```

For Wegert, these declarations keep two decisions separate: `touch_beginning`
records what was under the finger when it went down, while `placement_kind`
records what an empty-space tap should add.

`choice` starts the declaration and `one_of` is its contextual separator.
Each indented alternative has a lower snake_case name followed by zero or more
ordinary Idris payload types. Standard documentation, visibility, and totality
modifiers are accepted; exported models should use `export` or `public export`
as usual.

The declaration means that a value is exactly one of the listed alternatives
and is lowered directly to the compiler's existing data-declaration
representation. “Storage-neutral” means the syntax makes no promise about
runtime layout, alternative marker values, alternative ordering as an ABI,
serialization, or persistent storage. It introduces neither product nor
whole-value syntax.

The dialect distinction is filename-scoped. Only `.idric` promotes `choice` to
a keyword, and `one_of` remains contextual. In ordinary `.idr` files both
`choice` and `one_of` remain available as identifiers. Lowercase choice type
and alternative names resolve correctly in signatures and exhaustive patterns,
without disabling normal Idris auto-implicit binding for unrelated lowercase
names.

## Working copy

Preferred checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/isomorphisms/Idric.git /opt/Idric
cd /opt/Idric
```

If `/opt` is not writable, use `~/opt/Idric`.

## Repo-local Scheme toolchain

A system-wide Chez Scheme installation is not required. The root `edric` command installs the pinned threaded Chez Scheme toolchain under the ignored directory `.tools`:

```sh
./edric scheme
```

The stable executable path is:

```text
.tools/bin/scheme
```

The installer fetches the official Chez Scheme 10.4.1 source archive, verifies its SHA-256 digest, builds without X11 or curses, installs it under `.tools/chez-10.4.1`, and verifies that `(threaded?)` returns `#t`.

For a machine without outbound network access, provide the same verified archive explicitly:

```sh
CHEZ_ARCHIVE=/path/to/csv10.4.1.tar.gz ./edric scheme
```

The host still needs a C compiler, `make`, `tar`, and either `sha256sum` or `shasum`. `curl` or `wget` is needed only when `CHEZ_ARCHIVE` is not supplied.

## Build and test

From a clean checkout, the complete checkpoint build is:

```sh
./edric
```

That is equivalent to:

```sh
./edric scheme
./edric bootstrap
./edric test
```

The individual underlying commands remain available:

```sh
make bootstrap SCHEME="$PWD/.tools/bin/scheme"
make test only=idris2/basic/edric001
make test only=idris2/basic/edric002
make test only=idris2/basic/edric003
make test only=idris2/basic/edric004
make test only=idris2/basic/edric005
make test only=idris2/basic/edric006
make test only=idris2/basic/edric007
```

## Idriç koans

The progressive teaching suite lives in `koans`. It is part of this repository
so the exercises are checked against the exact compiler revision that defines
their syntax and semantics.

After bootstrapping the compiler, start at the first unfinished exercise:

```sh
./koans/run
```

The compiler stops at the first named hole, coverage failure, or other proof
obligation. Edit that exercise and run the command again. Reference solutions
and the suite's self-check are available separately:

```sh
./koans/run --solutions
./koans/run --validate
```

## Change discipline

For each language change:

1. Make the smallest parser, elaborator, or compiler change that expresses the idea.
2. Add a focused regression test under the existing Idris 2 test harness.
3. Keep ordinary Idris 2 behavior working unless the change explicitly replaces it.
4. Record user-visible syntax and semantic decisions here when they become part of Edric rather than leaving them only in a conversation.
5. Keep the default `Idriç` branch buildable; use a descriptive branch when an
   experiment is not yet coherent.

## New-thread handoff

A new thread working on Edric should:

1. Open this file, [BRANCHES.md](BRANCHES.md), and the root `README.md`.
2. Inspect the latest commits and current branch before changing code.
3. Use `./edric` to establish the repo-local Scheme toolchain, bootstrap the compiler, and run the focused handoff test.
4. Treat this repository as authoritative for implemented state. Conversation notes may explain intent but do not override the checked-in source and tests.
5. Update this checkpoint when a new architectural decision would otherwise be lost between threads.

## Current state

- Modern Idris 2 foundation: established.
- Durable repository handoff: established.
- Ordinary Idris 2 implementation language: established.
- Pinned repo-local threaded Chez Scheme bootstrap: established.
- Focused Edric handoff test: checked in.
- Idriç source extension: `.idric`; `.idr` remains accepted for Idris compatibility.
- `.idric` uses `Float16` as its ordinary floating type; decimal literals cross a binary16 rounding boundary and Float16 arithmetic rounds after each basic operation.
- `.idric` accepts `Double`, `Float`, `Float32`, and `Float64` as ragged precision requests, coerces them to `Float16`, and emits a nonfatal narrowing warning; ordinary `.idr` keeps inherited `Double` behavior.
- The present Float16 implementation uses a wider internal carrier; native/unboxed Float16 CPU and GPU lowering remains backend work rather than a source-language prerequisite.
- Storage-neutral, lower snake_case `choice ... one_of` syntax: implemented for `.idric` only.
- Ordinary `.idr` use of `choice` and `one_of` as identifiers: preserved and regression-tested.
- Idriç source accepts `→`, `⇒`, `←`, and `≤` as compact aliases for `->`, `=>`, `<-`, and `<=`; the ASCII spellings remain accepted.
- The aliases are filename-scoped to `.idric`; ordinary `.idr` Unicode identifiers remain unchanged.
- Canonical Unicode pretty-printing is not yet claimed by this input-syntax slice.
- Historical broad mechanical Unicode rewrite: reference only, not the base.
- Twelve progressive Idriç koans cover holes, dependent types, quantitative
  multiplicities, storage-neutral choices, compatibility boundaries, and a
  small Wegert model; their exercises and solutions are compiler-tested.
