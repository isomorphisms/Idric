# Unified higher-mathematics semantics

This directory is the conservative reconciliation of the higher-mathematics
experiments in issues and pull requests #42, #45, #46, and #47.  It is a
small, compiler-checked semantic example, not a general mathematics library.

## Established model

`FiniteSpace` carries a nominal `SpaceName` and a known coordinate rank.  The
name is itself indexed by its rank, so `PlaneName` cannot be reused at rank
128.  The complete `FiniteSpace`, rather than its rank alone, indexes
`ExactVectorSample`, `ExactCovectorSample`, `IndexedValue`,
`EuclideanStructure`, and the orthogonal types.  Consequently `planeSpace`
and `imagePlaneSpace` remain different even though both have rank two.

`ExactVectorSample space` and `ExactCovectorSample space` are separate
datatypes.  They are explicitly the executable integer-coordinate fragment of
the named real coordinate space, not its complete carrier and not a claim that
the field of real scalars is `Integer`.  Every represented sample nevertheless
denotes a genuine vector or covector.  The metric-free operation is covector
evaluation:

```idris
contract : ExactCovectorSample space -> ExactVectorSample space -> Integer
```

`RawExactCoordinates`, `UnsafeVectorCoordinates`, and the other
`unsafe...`/`Unsafe...` names form an explicit representation boundary kept
public for the exact #47 fixture and cross-module normalization.  Destructing
and rebuilding through that boundary can deliberately erase a role or name;
it is raw interoperability, not implicit mathematical inference.  The checked
API never performs such a conversion silently.

There is deliberately no checked vector-to-covector conversion in
`MathematicalSpaces`.  `EuclideanStructure space` supplies that additional
identification through `lowerIndex` and `raiseIndex`; `dot`, `norm`,
`distance`, and index raising/lowering on exact samples all require the
structure explicitly.  The current witness is the standard coordinate
Euclidean structure.  `norm` and `distance` retain an exact symbolic square
root rather than silently choosing floating-point arithmetic.  A complete
real-scalar representation remains deliberately unchosen.

`OrthogonalTransform structure orientation` is indexed by the particular
Euclidean structure and by `Preserving` or `Reversing`.  Its public
constructors are restricted to the settled identity, first-axis reflection,
first-plane quarter-turn, exact integral unit-quaternion rotation, and
composition.  `applyOrthogonalExact` interprets that same closed syntax on
exact samples; composition means `left (right sample)`.  This removes the old
disconnect between marker values and separate generator evaluators.  The
orientation indices record the reviewed standard maps; Idric does not derive
their determinants or a general metric-preservation theorem in this slice.
`SpecialOrthogonal structure` contains only orientation-preserving values.
Thus the first-axis reflection is orientation-reversing and two reflections
compose into `SO`, without pretending that this example can certify an
arbitrary user-supplied matrix or represent every quaternionic rotation.

The Einstein-style experiment is intentionally only a one-index kernel.
`LowerIndex` contains a covector, `UpperIndex` contains a vector, and
`contractIndex` accepts opposite variance over the same complete named-space
index.  Equal ranks neither erase a name mismatch nor permit same-variance
contraction.  A variance change goes through `lowerIndexed` or `raiseIndexed`
and therefore requires a Euclidean structure.

The finite presheaf example remains in `PresheafRestriction.idric`.  It shares
the strategy of making inclusions and section domains indices, but it does not
depend on Euclidean geometry.  It models three opens, their stated
inclusions, restriction identity and composition, and componentwise
restriction of a formal elementary pair.  It claims neither a general
presheaf interface nor a tensor-product or sheaf construction.

`TopologyFacts.idric` preserves the mathematically settled slice of #45:

- checked unit-sphere samples indexed by their ambient Euclidean structure;
- the closed additive integral-cohomology rank formula and Euler
  characteristic for ordinary spheres;
- exact quaternion multiplication and norm-one sample values;
- the real dimension, Hopf-sphere dimension, and closed additive integral
  cohomology ranks of CP^n;
- explicit theorem-boundary values for Jordan separation and the one-point
  compactification of Euclidean R^n.

Those are encoded standard facts.  The compiler is not computing general
cohomology, constructing quotient spaces, or deriving separation theorems
from coordinates.

## Six knowledge boundaries

| Source of knowledge | Role in this example | What it does not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary type unification | Requires the same full `FiniteSpace`; indexed names prevent both equal-rank conflation and one name acquiring conflicting ranks. | It cannot turn equal coordinate counts into space equality or supply a metric. |
| Dependent-index normalization | Reduces rank-indexed constructors, literal exact arithmetic, and closed dimension/rank formulas used by `Refl`. | It does not consult named topology facts. |
| Structure information | An explicit `EuclideanStructure space` enables lowering, raising, dot products, norms, distances, and the closed O/SO operations on exact samples. | It is not ordinary unification and is not inferred merely from a rank. |
| Algebraic laws | Closed transform syntax, typed witnesses, and focused equalities record norm-one samples, restriction laws, orientation composition, and exact generator oracles. | The example does not certify arbitrary matrices, prove a general norm-preservation theorem, or synthesize transformations. |
| Named fact lookup | `NamedFact` applies a selected entry to an exact typed hypothesis in `TypedContext` and returns a typed `FactAnswer` with declared attribution and a structured named origin. | It performs no search, proves no stored implication, and does not validate or authenticate metadata. |
| External/CAS evidence | Historical SymPy and NumPy/SciPy checks plus the retained dependency-free exact script independently corroborate #47; see [HIGH_DIMENSIONAL_VERIFICATION.md](HIGH_DIMENSIONAL_VERIFICATION.md). | External output is neither imported evidence nor a substitute for the current compiler receipt. |

The named-fact proof of concept contains one entry,
`topology.jordan-separation@1`.  Its typed hypothesis is an embedded circle in
S^2 and its typed conclusion is the corresponding two-component separation
fact.  Here the embedding value is an explicit assumption token; no map or
injectivity property is inferred or checked.  A `NamedFact H C` stores
human-declared attribution plus an Idriç function `(h : H) -> C h`.  Lookup
explicitly applies that selected entry to `TypedContext H`; the type checker
enforces the exact hypothesis type, and the answer says that it came through
named lookup rather than unification.  This is the boundary requested by #42
and the companion design note `walnut-burgundy/computer-science#56`; it is not
a registry search engine, theorem prover, authenticated provenance system, or
the downstream symbolic planner of `computer-science#54`.

## Compiler receipt and fixture isolation

The focused receipt is `tests/idris2/basic/edric009`.  It copies the six
modules without renaming their `.idric` suffixes, runs the bootstrapped Idric
compiler's `--check` path, builds an executable, and checks its output.  The
negative declarations use `failing`, so the receipt also requires the
compiler to reject space conflation, dimension mismatch, same-variance
contraction, vector-vector contraction without a metric, and application of a
transform to an equal-rank but differently named space.

Using `edric009` resolves the inherited fixture collision: the #45/#47 and
#46 experiments both used an `edric008` fixture on separate branches.  Their
verified behavior is brought into one new fixture rather than choosing one
branch's fixture and silently discarding the other.

Run only this slice with:

```sh
./edric test --only idris2/basic/edric009
```

The exact R^128 oracle and the distinction between primary compiler evidence
and secondary historical checks are recorded in
[HIGH_DIMENSIONAL_VERIFICATION.md](HIGH_DIMENSIONAL_VERIFICATION.md).

## Inherited provenance

All inherited experiment branches diverged from
`9b0bf7fa8be9483440e6ec0530f3aef3999a8735`.  This reconciliation is based on
the then-current `Idriç` tip
`58295f6fb49a823c5c0880568b30cff513d42d7b`; neither historical branch was
treated as a replacement compiler line.

| Work | Inherited branch | Exact inherited tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Issue #42 and its #46 implementation | `examples/higher-math-constraint-inference` | `c2e5945e209cbf9ab055e3c127c4b981313242fc` |
| PR #45 | `examples/linear-geometry-type-core` | `6b46694b26328ae4b71134ce8b52bdb8c00fb4e8` |
| PR #47 | `examples/high-dimensional-orthogonal-tests` | `214ceaffdb38389bef65b8fa63f73f24d66a609e` |

Within #47, commit `1ee26112670866dea3f9a679645aa45f898be3d1`
is the crucial strengthening that put a nonzero value in coordinate 128.  The
unified fixture preserves that oracle rather than replacing it with a smaller
or weaker example.

## Deliberate deferrals

The smallest coherent boundary leaves the following choices open:

- a scalar-field abstraction, complete real-vector carrier, and exact
  representation of arbitrary real coordinates;
- named spaces whose dimension is unknown, infinite, or learned only at run
  time (`FiniteSpace` covers the present known-rank slice only);
- multiple bases or multiple nondefinitionally-equal metrics on one named
  space, indefinite bilinear forms, arbitrary matrix certification, and a
  reusable proof that every closed transform preserves the metric;
- a typed action on `UnitSpherePoint`: the exact transform evaluator is
  connected now, but lifting it to certified sphere samples awaits that
  reusable norm-preservation proof rather than wrapping an unchecked image;
- general tensor syntax, tensor products, or an Einstein elaborator beyond
  the variance- and space-aware one-index kernel;
- general presheaves, sheafification, arbitrary quotient equality, and the
  ring structure or computation of general homology/cohomology;
- theorem search, theorem proving, CAS integration, and the downstream
  symbolic planner.

These are semantic extensions, not cleanup required to reconcile the current
experiments.  Adding them would require new mathematical choices and new
focused tests.
